### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matias

I'm a Front-End & App Developer.

I spend my days (and often my nights) painting the canvas of the internet with projects and lines of code, turning zeros and ones into engaging, user-centric digital experiences.

These days, I'm a Front-End developer at [Bosquestudio](https://bosquestudio.cl/).
